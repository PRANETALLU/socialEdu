When a User likes a post, their username/userID is stored in the post Object (stored in Array).

The Author of the post will receive notifications by going into Array, retreiving stored username of User who liked, and formatting "[User] liked your post."


When a User wants to like or dislike a post, we will:
- check to see if the user has already liked post
- if yes:
    - remove userID from post 'like' history
    - update number of likes by taking size of Like Array
    - (Later) remove notification from Author's notification section

- else:
    - store user ID into post history
    - update like number for post in backend and frontend
    - change status of "Like" heart icon for user
    - (Later) notify Author of post
